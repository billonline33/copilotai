## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 Primary User Stories

1. **As Bianca**, I want to select different counting patterns so I can practice what I'm learning at school
2. **As Bianca**, I want to see if my answers are correct immediately so I know if I'm doing well
3. **As Bianca**, I want to earn points and see celebrations when I get answers right so I feel motivated
4. **As Bianca**, I want easy-to-use buttons and clear instructions so I can use the app independently
5. **As a parent**, I want to see Bianca's progress so I can understand how she's improving

### 5.2 Secondary User Stories

1. **As Bianca**, I want to practice counting backwards over decades so I can get better at this challenging skill
2. **As Bianca**, I want to start counting from any number so I can practice different scenarios
3. **As Bianca**, I want the app to work on the tablet so I can practice anywhere
